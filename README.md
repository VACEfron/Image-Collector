# Discord Bot C# 
This is the source code I made based on my Discord bot called [Konek0](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=604001646514667541&scope=bot&permissions=1543892215). You can use this source to easily get started with making a Discord bot in C#. Crediting me isn't necessary, but will definitely be appreciated. Have fun!
